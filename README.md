A vanilla JS library (work in progress)

## History

In 2020 january, I started building a web components library. It took me about 3 month to build the RS_WCL (see my other public repos).

But I did quick, because I was spending more time searching how to technically make it work as I intended it to, than to think about its code design.

Since this time, javascript evolved a lot... so as I did.

This is why I decided to build this library again, with a better code design, getting deeper into the concepts, and using more what JS, HTML and CSS provide nowadays.

I hope you will enjoy dicovering it, as much as I did thinking and writing it.
